# PandaGame

This is the result of a detour into game development with C# and Unity.

In this 2d platformer inspired by a popular children's video series, you help baby panda find the missing stars.

The first level gradually introduces more difficult obstacles for the player to overcome. After completing the first level and hitting "play again", a randomly generated map will be created for the player.
